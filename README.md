## MVP

### Project-build Aspects:

The following components are used to build the code for this project:

1. JavaScript >  Node.js > npm:
    - mysql2
    - Sequelize
    - Express.js
    - dotenv
2. MySQL Workbench
3. Insomnia Core


### Functionality:

* using Sequelize Model to build database tables:
    - 'Category', 'Product', 'Tag', 'ProductTag'
    - 'ProductTag' table used for relating 'Product' and 'Tag' table only
* using Express.js to perform RESTful CRUD operations
    - CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE from all three database tables (please refer to the [walkthrough video](#Application-Walkthrough)

### Process:

* source starter code provided by the bootcamp program (please see [Credit](#Credit) section)
* `npm init` ran to create package.json file
* required packages installed as dependencies
* using MySQL Workbench for model data to sync and populate to
* using Insomnia Core to test `GET`, `POST`, and `DELETE` routes
